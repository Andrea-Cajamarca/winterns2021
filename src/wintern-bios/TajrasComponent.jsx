    <p class='prvitext'> Hi, everyone! I am your new wintern in Software Engineering for 2021! I am a freshman at Kingsborough Community College, who is currently a major in Liberal Arts, but from Spring 2021 I will be majoring in Computer Science. </p>
     <p className='ostatak'>How I would describe myself is that I am someone who is always passionate about learning. One good advice my high school English teacher told me is,"Knowledge is the key that opens all doors!". I always liked this advice or some would call it saying because I find it to be true. There is never an end to our knowledge, so it means we can always upgrade ourselves as a software does too :D. Human softwares, maybe? </p>

        <li> I speak 5 languages fluently, which are: Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian (they are pretty similar, but have some small differences in accents), German, and English.</li>
        <li> I have 3 dogs. An English Springer Spaniel, 13 years old, named Dzina. A Chichon (Chihuahua mixed with Bishon), 2 years old, named Bella. A Yorkie, 4 years old, named Beko. </li>
        <li> My favorite meal are tacos because the country I come from, there are no tacos. Can you imagine ðŸ˜” ? </li>
        <li> My favorite colors are blue and green, as you might have noticed, and the Northern Lights are definitely something I want to see because I am into stargazing and find fascination in astronomy. </li>
